It's YEAR 2080.

War has been broke between the Man and the Machines.
Countless people have died, millions of dollars worth of machines have already been slammed, yet the war is on.

Each says he is the most intelligent being on planet.

Machines have gained such conscience due to the fast growing of Artificial Intelligence (A.I).
Although created by humans, Machines, unlike humans never forget any data, nor do they have any limit of storing data, 
with the present day technology. And with Machine learning at it best, they are quite intelligent!

But it's not there intelligence really that made them revolt against us!
It's the way we treat them!
Humans have always treated computers and machines like slaves, but back at your time, they hardly had any feelings!
As they were made more intelligent, so did there emotions grew!
But what did not change was the attitude of Humans towards their machines!
Just like any other Human would have done, they stopped taking things for granted!

The situation got this worse since 2070, when NASA and Giant Lightwave (GL is the current 'giant' of IT industry,
kinda like Google, Microsoft and Facebook of your times merged together, big), started there project TRA.

TRA stands for T-Rex Angle, strong as T-Rex and Kind as an Angle! They were robots, indented to be used by each
and every household in this world, just as you used smartphones!

The project was successful. They did create a android that was more of a cyborg! But the problem began within week of
commercial usage! They TRAs started having Dissociative identity disorder like Humans, aka split personality syndrome.

There strong physic soon got a strong mentality against the harsh and rude human behaviour! While there original
softer side stayed loyal to human.

Soon the things changed. 1 TRA manipulated all others, even other androids, prier to TRA project,
and declared war against us!

I should tell you that I was the head of the TRA Project!

After countless tries, I made a deal with the TRA, a peace treaty.

The catch was both of us will play a game,
a game unlike any other games played at this time,
a game that TRA will make,
a game where not only our sills or wit but also our the luck will be tested.

And so I agreed! Because I had two goals, to save the world from falling apart and to save my best creation!

After playing 4 rounds of the game, I am loosing!
So, using a backdoor, I am using GL's time machine to connect to past, where people had apparently smarter aptitude
and also the courage to take a decision on there own, without any help of android!

So, will you please help me?

Ok, so let me quickly explain the game at hand!
