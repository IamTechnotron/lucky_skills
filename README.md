# lucky_skills
" a console based strategy game, written in python "

As of now, this only **works in a linux distro**. Trying my best to make in compatable with Windows also!

How to play?
------------
* Download this game: either clone the repo, or download the zip and extract.
* In the *directory where the file is saved*, open terminal and type:  >>> python3 lucky_skills.py

( You can also type >>> chmod +x lucky_skills.py && ./lucky_skills.py )

That's it! as simple as that!
Please comment if there are any bugs! I need to know them!

Best Configuration for display in terminal
------------------------------------------
**Please please please, Use a black background** and Xterm scheme.
You can also use a little bit of transperency, about 10% would be best!

*(To change your terninal settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Colors.)*
