# lucky_skills
a console based strategy game, written in python

@ As of now, this only works in a linux distro. Trying my best to make in compatable with Windows also!

# How to play?
Download this game, and in that directory, open terminal and type: python3 lucky_skills.py
That's it! as simple as that!
Please comment if there are any bugs! I need to know them!
